## Tech Stack ##

* [ExpressJS](http://expressjs.com/) - is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) - is a giant leap forward that helps organizations standardize on a single, modern database for their new, mission-critical applications.
* [Mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/) - elegant mongodb object modeling for node.js
